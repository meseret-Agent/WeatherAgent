## How to Run

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment

Before running the application, activate the virtual environment. **Note:** The `.venv` folder is in the project root directory.

**If you're in the project root** :

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

*Windows:*
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**If you're already in the `ai_agent` directory:**

*macOS/Linux:*
```bash
source ../.venv/bin/activate
```

*Windows:*
```bash
..\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

After activation, you should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

To deactivate when you're done:
```bash
deactivate
```

### 2. Streamlit Weather Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the `ai_agent` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai_agent
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:
